                DateMate is a responsive web app for people to access anonymous advice and coaching relating to dating
                and relationships. The project was focused on expanding my UX design skill set, with a focus on
                usability testing.

                <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>To start this journey I took a look at other apps already looking to solve this need.
                    Immediately it became apparent that there were very few competitors in this field so I had to expand
                    the search to applications looking to provide broad advice on relationships and dating.
                    From this research, I generated user stories to guide my project further.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>To further explore the problem space, I conducted interviews with 3 users from the target
                    demographic. I then created affinity maps to organise the data and extrapolate insights.
                    Research Insights:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verification, reassurance and trust are common themes so we should align our design strategy
                            to provide these to our users.</li>
                        <li>Ultimately, what users are looking for is CONFIDENCE (“My profile is a good one and likely
                            to attract relevant and genuine matches”; “I have accurate information on sex and sexual
                            health”; “I have been given dating advice and tips from an expert who has relevant
                            experience or qualifications”.</li>
                        <li> Users are more like to reach out for advice from a “friend” figure, however, this contrasts
                            with the need for advice from an authoritative figure. Our challenge will therefore be to
                            construct the concept of an “Authoritative Friend”.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                </picture>
                <h3>User Personas</h3>
                <p>From the data gathered from the user interviews, I created two key user personas to drive the design
                    decisions. These were key in reminding me of the role of the user in the design process, and as the
                    profile that most clearly represented my target demographic I often found myself saying:
                    <span>WWMD: What Would Matt Do?</span>
                    From there I was also able to generate task analysis from the key app functions and user flows.
                    These ended up being a big part of determining my information hierarchy within the app and
                    ultimately created the general flow of the entire app experience.

                <h3>Task Analysis & User flows</h3>
                <p>I created task analysis and user flows for the 3 key features of my app by leveraging the perspective
                    of my user personas. The user flows were especially important in determining the screens required
                    and the general outline of the sitemap. I tried to keep the number of steps to complete each task to
                    a minimum while also trying to delineate each task flow sufficiently so that users were not confused
                    about the flow they were in. This was ultimately much improved by my card sorting exercise later in
                    the project.

                <h3>
                    Sitemap
                </h3>
                <p>Once I had a clear understanding of the problems I was trying to solve and some information about how
                    the user might solve these problems from the user journeys and user flows, it was time to start
                    piecing together a sitemap.
                    After creating a rough draft of a sitemap, I performed a card sorting using the same users I
                    interviewed previously. The card sort results were then used to refine the sitemap.
                    The card sort was pretty clear in the 3 key areas of the app that needed to be fleshed out. I used
                    this information to then make decisions about the app navigation. Specifically, I decided that the 3
                    areas indicated by the card sort should be given a tab in the bottom bar navigation as these are
                    going to be the most used areas of the app. Other, less used, functions could be accessed through a
                    hamburger menu.

                <h3>Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
                <p>I spent a long time looking at other apps and how they implemented their functionality before
                    evaluating which would be the best approach for my app. For example, the Knowledge section on my
                    desktop wireframes was influenced by the design of Medium.com.
                    I sketched low-fidelity wireframes by hand initially, before converting them to digital copies. Once
                    I had a clearer idea of the design I was going for, I created medium-fidelity wireframes that I then
                    merged into an initial prototype. After usability testing this prototype, I then incrementally
                    iterated the design to incorporate user feedback, follow Material Design principles, follow
                    accessibility guidelines and also reflect peer feedback.
                    I really enjoyed the paper prototyping as it gave me a quick, hands-on way to explore the problem
                    and ideate solutions. However, I found that I initially struggled to then convert the paper
                    prototypes into digital copies for sharing and prototyping. In the future, I’d be interested to
                    explore using digital sketching tools to create initial wireframes that, while still low-fidelity,
                    are also easily shared/manipulated digitally. The process was a long one but I learned a lot
                    throughout.

                </picture>
                <h3>Usability testing</h3>
                <p>I conducted usability testing on the prototype of Datemate using 6 participants from my personal
                    network. Tests were conducted virtually, and after an initial briefing, participants were asked to
                    perform specific tasks using the prototype.
                    Participants reported a high level of satisfaction using the prototype and concluded it was very
                    easy to use. Several feedback points were repeated by different participants, giving confidence that
                    a small number of usability improvements would have a greater effect on overall usability.
                    I also conducted a simple A/B preference test on potential homepage designs. While users clearly
                    preferred one design over another, it was actually the additional comments they made during testing
                    that I found most useful in driving the design forward.
                    Once I felt the design was at the “polishing” stage, I shared it with my peers to gather feedback
                    from other designers. The feedback I got was extremely valuable for small changes that really pulled
                    the design together. I wish I had shared the design with others at earlier stages as well.

                <h3>Project Conclusions</h3>
                <p>I learned a lot throughout the course of this project. For the most part, I was completing tasks I
                    had never attempted before and I would do a lot of things differently next time.
                    I think my biggest takeaway here would be the cyclical nature of the design process. Initially, I
                    was frustrated at having to return to previously made decisions and re-evaluate them based on new
                    information, but I quickly learned that this was all part of the process.
                    I’m proud that I stuck to my goal of not getting too “lost in the weeds”. I have previously
                    struggled with insisting that every stage of a project be ‘perfect’ before moving on, but here I was
                    able to go with the flow a little more and not worry so much about the details in the early stages
                    of the project. I think ultimately it improved the design decisions I made because I wasn’t afraid
                    of losing work I’d spent a lot of time on.
